# Python-implementation-of-an-elevator-evacuation-problem-using-DFS-BFS-and-Best-First-Search.
School project for Artificial Intelligence-based elevator evacuation problem: Implements DFS, BFS, and Best-First Search algorithms to efficiently evacuate residents to the rooftop.


This Python project simulates an emergency evacuation scenario in a multi-story building where an elevator must transport residents to safety using different search algorithms (DFS, BFS, Best-First Search).
The goal is to ensure that all residents reach the rooftop safely while optimizing elevator movements.

Algorithms Used:

  Depth-First Search (DFS)
  Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  Best-First Search (BestFS)
